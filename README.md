AppleMockup
This is a personal project to simulate a tech page such as Apple to showcase their new devices, show the details for all the new products, a news page to keep up to date with the company, an account page to keep track of orders and others, and a cart page to keep track of items in the customers cart.

I will try to use React for responsive and reactive elemnts such as adding items to cart and removing items from cart and the quantity of items in cart. I will try to use jQuery to animate different elements of the webpage such as scrolling.

I have not updated this website in quite a while as I have been working on other projects, will restart development on this page soon.
